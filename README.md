# 🏨 Hotel Booking App (React Native - Frontend)

This is the **frontend mobile application** for a simple hotel booking system.

## 🔗 Backend API

⚠️ This repo only contains the **frontend mobile app**.
The app requires a backend API to function (for hotel listings, bookings, and admin management).
👉 Update the API base URL in the project config (`src/config.js` or `.env`) to point to your backend server.
